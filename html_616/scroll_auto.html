			1. scrollBy(x,y)
			상대적 위치
			현재 위치를 기준으로 파라미터 값으로 넘겨준 만큼 이동합니다.
			창을 상대적인 좌표로 스크롤합니다.

			// scrollBy(가로 스크롤 값, 세로 스크롤 값);
			window.scrollBy(100, 100);
			현재 스크롤 위치에서 x스크롤을 100만큼,
											y스크롤을 100만큼 이동시킵니다.
			
			2. scrollTo(x, y)
			절대적 위치
			왼쪽 상단 모서리 부터 시작하여 전체 스크롤 값을 기준으로
			파라미터로 넘겨준 값으로 이동합니다.
			( 현재 위치가 아닌 상단 모서리를 기준으로 합니다.)

			창을 절대적인 좌표로 이동합니다.
			
			// scrollTo(가로 스크롤 값, 세로 스크롤 값);
			window.scrollTo(100, 100);

			위 메서드들의 차이점은 기준점 그리고 절대적인지
			상대적인지에 대해 차이가 있습니다.

  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by <br>the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less <br>normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content <br>here, content here', making it look like readable English. <br>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors <br>now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a <br>search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in <br>their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the <br>years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <br>(injected humour and the like).
